Your App should have from 28 to 31 cells (depends on month)

#### On hover on cell, opens modal window that will show Us a weather on the day of month that we hover.
#### On click on cell, we opened a page that show us a weather on the day of month that we clicked.
#### Every time when we click the cell, we make a request to get a data about the weather from this API: https://openweathermap.org/current

## Please describe:
1) What structure you will create for the App
2) How would you call the routes?
3) How to create page NotFound?
4) When you will call fetch, in which react lifecycle method?
5) How to cache the data that called again on the same cell?
6) What Redux store structure will you propose?
7) HOw to optimize data?
